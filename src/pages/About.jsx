            For too long, the field of security has been limited by outdated
            thinking and a refusal to consider the broader context in which
            conflicts are embedded. As a result, scholars and policymakers alike
            are often playing catch-up, forced to react to destabilizing events
            rather than anticipate them.
            <br />
            At the New Security Project, we aim to rethink what security means
            in the 21st century by fostering new ideas and solutions for
            addressing instability and creating more resilient societies.

            The world is changing rapidly, and so must our understanding of
            security. Climate change is displacing millions of people. Economic
            inequality is fueling unrest. Disinformation is corroding the social
            fabric of democratic societies.
            <br />
            At the New Security Project, we believe that reimagining security is
            not just an academic exerciseâ€”it's an urgent necessity. By embracing
            an interdisciplinary approach and engaging with leaders in different
            fields from around the world, we hope to contribute to a safer, more
            equitable future for all.
